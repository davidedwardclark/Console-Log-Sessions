# Hello World
# print("Hello world")

# Get a website and print text
# import requests
# resp = requests.get("https://davidedwardclark.com")
# html = resp.text
# print(html)

# Inline comment spacing = 2
# print("#blah")  # Like this.

# Variable types
# print(type("Hello, world"))
# print(type(5))

# Strings
# single_quote_string = 'blah, I said "blahahaha" to him'
# double_quote_string = "hah"
# print(single_quote_string)
# print(double_quote_string)
# print(len(single_quote_string))

# Line Lengths
# Each line of Python code should contain no more than 79 characters.

# Long Strings
# long_string = "This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy."
# print(long_string)

# String Manipulation
# string1 = "blah1"
# string2 = "blah2"
# string3 = string1 + " " + string2
# print(string3)

# String Indexing
# string1 = "abcdefghijklmnop"
# print(string1[0])
# print(string1[1])
# print(string1[-1])

# String Slicing
# [starting character : how many characters to include]
# string2 = "apple pie"
# print(string2[0:3])
# If you omit the second index in the slice it defaults to the whole string..
# string3 = "apple pie"
# print(string3[3:])
# If you omit the first index in a slice, Python assumes you want to start at index 0.
# string4 = "apple pie"
# print(string4[:4])
# Negative values too.
# string4 = "apple pie"
# print(string4[-3:-1])

# String Methods
# string = "David Clark"
# print(string.lower())
# print(string.upper())
# print(len(string))

# Types
# print(type(""))
# print(type(4))
# print(type({}))
# print(type([]))

# Remove Whitespace
# .rstrip()
# .lstrip()
# .strip()
# string = "   hahahahaahahaha   "
# print(string.rstrip())
# print(string.lstrip())
# print(string.strip())

# Starts With Ends With
# Case sensitive!
# .startswith()
# .endswith()
# string = "BLAH"
# print(string.startswith("BL"))
# print(string.endswith("H"))

# Immutible
# String in Pyton are immutible. So if we want to keep the manipulate string we need to store in in a value.
# string = "chAnGe Me aNd StOrE me"
# string2 = string.upper()
# print("orignal: ", string)
# print("modified with upper(): ", string2)

# String Methods

# string1 = "asdfasdfasdf"
# print(string1.isspace())

# Strings and Arrays
